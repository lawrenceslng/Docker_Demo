# DevOps Assignment #4: Containerize It

To bring up this application using docker compose, simply clone the repository, go to the root directory, and run `docker compose up`.

The 3 docker containers will be created. Wait until the db is fully initialized, then navigate to `localhost:3000` and use the app.

The code for the application is from the [repository linked here](https://github.com/Norbert305/crud-react-node-mySQL-go).
